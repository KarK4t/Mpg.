 My birthday is November 7th! PLEASE for the love of GOD tell me your age before we intend to be friends. it makes me a bit irritated if i dont know.
 
 I get distracted real easily. So i may lose focus on you or anyone.
 
 i love making friends, but please DO NOT force me to unfriend someone. i will feel unsafe around you. and yes, i hate being forced to do something.

 I am mostly sensitive, may not look like it but i really am. i try not to tho. and i do get alot of stress which will lead me to having a breakdown.
